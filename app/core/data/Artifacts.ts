I started with a 2D array (rows and columns) of 3D points (x, y, z), laying them out in a uniform grid then offsetting each in all three dimensions by a randomised amount. I wrote a face drawing function to select the correct triplet of vertices from the row/column array and draw a face between them, shading or brightening the initial colour based on the 3D orientation of each face's normal. I assigned each vertex three sine functions (one for each dimension) of a random amplitude but constant period, and offset the period of each by a fixed amount. Finally, I incremented the input for each sine function by a fixed amount per frame, and redrew the triangles each time.",
